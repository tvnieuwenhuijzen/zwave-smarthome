        <h1>Welcome to your Smart Home</h1>
        <div>
            This interface allows managing your Smart Home equipped with interconnected Z-Wave devices. It will show every function of the device as one single <strong>Element</strong> 
            (In case a physical device has multiple functions like switching and metering â€“ it will generate multiple elements). 
            All elements are listed in the <strong>Element View</strong> and can be filtered by function type (switch, dimmer, sensor) or other filtering criteria. <br><br>
            Each Element has an <strong>Element Configuration Dialog</strong> to rename it or to hide it in case was created but it is not needed. Important elements can be marked to be shown in the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. 
            Additionally the elements can be grouped into rooms. <br><br>Every change of a sensor value or a switching status is called an <strong>Event</strong> and is shown in the <strong>Timeline</strong>. 
            Filtering allows monitoring the changes of one single function or device. <br><br>
            <div ng-if="elementAccess(cfg.role_access.admin)">
                All other functions such as time triggered actions, the use of information from the Internet, scenes plugin of other technologies and service are realized in <strong>Apps</strong>. 
                These apps can create none, one or multiple new elements and events. The menu <a href="#apps/local" class="btn btn-default"><i class="fa fa-cubes"></i> {{_t('nav_apps')}}</a> allows downloading, activating and configuring your Apps. <br><br>
                To Add a new device please follow the instruction under <a href="#devices" class="btn btn-default"><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> {{_t('nav_devices')}}</a>
